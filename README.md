This is an extension to the project in part-1. Here, data biasing is addressed to see whether any of the five applied classification models show improvement in accuracy results obtained.

Fixing Biasing in Data
         The biasing in data needs to be addressed to upgrade the overall performance of a classifier. Two techniques have been studied which are as follows:
1.	Under sampling: This reduces data imbalance to a great extent by making the majority class label close to the minority class label through sampling.
2.	Over sampling:  This reduces data imbalance to a great extent by the minority class label close to the majority class label through sampling.
Probability based simple random sampling is used in which in which each member of the subset has an equal chance of being selected.

Analysis of Accuracy Variation with Sampling:
Under-sampling yields better results in case of Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes while for other classifiers accuracy decreases. However, Over-sampling under performs in case in of each of the classifiers and accuracy is reduced.
